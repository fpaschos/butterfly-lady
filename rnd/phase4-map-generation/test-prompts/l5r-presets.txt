QUICK TIPS FOR TESTING
=======================

1. START SIMPLE
   - Test Preset 1 (Rural) first - it's the simplest
   - Use 768x768 for faster generation
   - No ControlNet for first test

2. ADJUST CFG SCALE
   - Too generic? Increase to 7-8
   - Too strict/artificial? Decrease to 5-6
   - Sweet spot: 6-7 for most maps

3. ADD CONTROLNET
   - After basic prompts work, enable ControlNet Unit 0 (Scribble)
   - See controlnet-presets.md for full setup
   - Weight 1.1 for good structure

4. ITERATE
   - Generate 4 variations (Batch count: 4)
   - Pick best layout
   - Use img2img to refine details

5. COMMON FIXES
   - Still looks European? Add "(japanese:1.3)" to positive prompt
   - Has perspective? Add "(top-down:1.3)" and "perspective" to negative
   - Too dark? Add "bright lighting" to positive
   - Too cluttered? Add "clean", "minimal" to positive

---

CONTROLNET QUICK SETUP (OPTIONAL)
==================================

For sketch-based generation:

ControlNet Unit 0:
- Enable: Yes
- Preprocessor: scribble_xdog
- Model: control_v11p_sd15_scribble
- Weight: 1.1
- Control Mode: ControlNet is more important

Then use any preset above with your sketch as input.

NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Copy a preset (positive + negative + settings)
2. Paste into WebUI (http://localhost:7860)
3. Click Generate
4. Wait ~2 minutes (CPU mode)
5. Iterate and refine
